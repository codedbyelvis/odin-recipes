     <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>There are many recipes for Cuban sandwiches. Here's how to build a Cuban with pulled pork.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) loaf Cuban bread</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups cooked pulled pork, heated</li>
        <li>6 thin slices smoked fully-cooked ham</li>
        <li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>1 large dill pickle, sliced thinly lengthwise</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>¼ cup mustard</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, mustard, and cayenne together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
        <li>Trim off ends of bread. Cut loaf in half and evenly split bread to make tops and bottoms of two sandwiches.</li>
        <li>Spread evenly and generously on all slices of bread with previously-made sauce.</li>
        <li>Divide sandwich ingredients between the two bottom halves in this order: 
        <br>2 slices of Swiss cheese, 3 slices ham, hot cooked pork, pickle slices, and 2 more slices of Swiss cheese. Place tops on sandwiches.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Place the sandwiches in the skillet and press them down with a heavy weight, such as another skillet or foil-wrapped bricks.
            Toast the sandwiches until bread is crisp and filling is heated through, 3 or 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
