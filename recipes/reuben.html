     <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. 
        The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of Rye Bread</li>
        <li>2 slices of deli-sliced corned-beef</li>
        <li>2 slices of Swiss cheese</li>
        <li>⅛ cup of Thousand Island dressing</li>
        <li>¼ cup of sauerkraut, drained</li>
        <li>½ tablespoons of butter, softened</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>(Quick Tip: Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium-heat while you assemble your sandwich.)</p>
        <li>Spread one side of the 1st bread slice evenly with Thousand Island dressing.</li>
        <li>On that same slice, layer: <br>one slice of Swiss cheese, the corned beef, the sauerkraut,
             your second slice of Swiss cheese, and your 2nd slice of bread.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the butter one end of the sandwich.</li>
        <li>Place the sandwich butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of the sandwich with the remaining butter.</li>
        <li>Grill until both sides are golden brown. About 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
